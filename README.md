Hi! I'm Lindsey! I'm a software developer based in New Orleans, LA who loves to build and problem solve websites and web applications.
My journey to software development began as a youngster building Angelfire websites (HTML/CSS) about whatever was cool in the 90's. I went on to study graphic design and like many others, I quickly realized it was not my passion. I wanted to build websites and applications, things that can be both creative and solve problems.

I did some research and took my first software development course at Operation Spark where we focused on HTML, CSS and Javascript. After completion, I decided to continue my education with Lambda School. I enrolled in the immersive Full-Stack Web Development program. My time at Lambda School taught me, not only software development but leadership skills, teamwork and the importance of understanding the problem/goal and planning ahead.
